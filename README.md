In your README.md, be sure to have clear instructions on: 

    Installing dependencies for your project 
    Accessing or—if your project needs a server (not required)—running your project
    Running your smart contract unit tests and which port a local testnet should be running on.
    Note: This section used to require three bash scripts but has been revised.
