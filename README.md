# Decentralized Exchange in token "arcadios"

Arcadios is a decentralized exchange with its own token "arcadios" based on Ethereum. 

Decentralized exchange allows for trustless exchange of assets and tokens on Ethereum without giving away control of your assets.

In your README.md, be sure to have clear instructions on: 

### Usage

It is necessary to have a Metamask (https://metamask.io/) to conect the wallet to the app. When connected, your address will show on the top navigation bar. You can deposit your "arcadios" tokens, create orders by choosing the amount of token you want to get in exchange for amount of ether or vice versa, or fill open orders to make a trade.
